MIDI-Symphony is music editing program featuring procedural music generation tools. It is not guaranteed to produce good music, but it can generate good bits when given the right parameters. The idea is, you feed it a library of riffs for your instruments, and then you tell it to mix and match, and randomize smartly across various parameters. You can then zero-in on ideas you like, rearrange and combine them, and finally output it as midi to do as you like.
